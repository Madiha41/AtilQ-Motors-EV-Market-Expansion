# AtilQ-Motors-EV-Market-Expansion
Analysis of the Indian EV market for AtliQ Motors

## Overview
Today, I’m excited to present my project from the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge, titled **"AtilQ-Motors-EV-Market-Expansion"** This project focuses on delivering strategic insights and recommendations to support AtliQ Motors in entering and growing within the Indian EV market. Through thorough data analysis, I’ve identified key trends, opportunities, and actionable steps that can help the company achieve its expansion goals.

## Company Overview
AtliQ Motors, headquartered in the United States, specializes in electric vehicles and holds a strong market presence, capturing 25% of the EV/Hybrid segment in North America. As AtliQ Motors aims to expand into the Indian market, this project provides a detailed analysis to understand the Indian EV landscape and guide the company's expansion strategy.

## Problem Statement
Despite success in North America, AtliQ Motors faces a challenge in India, where their market share in the EV/Hybrid segment is under 2%. To ensure a successful launch of their bestselling models, understanding the Indian EV market is crucial. This project offers a comprehensive market study to address this need.

## Objective
The objective is to provide AtliQ Motors with actionable insights for their expansion strategy in India. The analysis covers current EV market trends, identifies growth opportunities and challenges, and offers data-driven recommendations for a successful market entry and expansion.

## Data Preparation & Modeling
The project utilizes datasets on electric vehicle sales by state and by makers, along with a date dimension table. Data preparation involved removing duplicates, addressing missing data, and creating additional tables to form a star schema. This structured data model optimized the analysis and reporting.
